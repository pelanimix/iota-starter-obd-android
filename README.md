# IBM IoT Connected Vehicle Insights - OBDII Fleet Management App for Android


## Overview
The IBM IoT Connected Vehicle Insights - Mobility Starter Application uses the **IBM IoT Platform** that is available on **IBM Cloud** to help you to quickly build a smart fleet management solution. The solution consists of a mobile app and a server component which is the **IBM IoT Connected Vehicle Insights - Fleet Management Starter Application**.

### Mobile app
The starter app provides a mobile app to connect to an OBDII dongle plugged in to your car. If you are a user of the application, you can use the mobile app to do the following tasks:

- See real-time data from your car on the screen
- Beam the data to the IBM IoT Platform, which will automatically get synced to the **Fleet Management Web Application**

While you drive the car, the service tracks your location and also records the health of your car. This will happen in the background, which means you could lock your phone in the meantime or use other applications.

Once you want to stop the application from recording your data, simply press "End Session", and the application will close.

You can currently download and install the mobile app on your Android mobile device.

### Server component
The "IBM IoT Connected Vehicle Insights - OBDII Fleet Management App" interacts with a server component. The server component provides the back-end fleet management and system monitoring service that provides more features for fleet management companies. By default, the mobile app connects to a test server that is provided by IBM. You can also choose to deploy your own server instance to IBM Cloud and connect your mobile app to that instance instead of the test system. For more information about deploying the fleet management server component, see [ibm-watson-iot/iota-starter-server-fm-saas](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iota-starter-server-fm-saas).


## Prerequisites

Before you deploy the Android application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
